            <h4>About me</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              As a passionate and driven software engineering intern, I am
              deeply intrigued by the dynamic intersection of cyber security and
              software development. Throughout my internship experiences, I have
              immersed myself in the world of coding, honing my skills in
              various programming languages and development frameworks. My
              interest, however, extends beyond just creating robust and
              efficient software; I am captivated by the challenges and
              complexities of cyber security. Exploring ways to fortify systems
              against potential threats and vulnerabilities has become a focal
              point of my learning journey. I am enthusiastic about contributing
              to the ever-evolving field of technology, leveraging my expertise
              in both software development and cyber security to create
              innovative and secure solutions.

            <p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

            <p>
              I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear
              apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out
              why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
              reference.

              Aside from building small projects, I would love to enter a
              position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others
              with more experience than myself.
